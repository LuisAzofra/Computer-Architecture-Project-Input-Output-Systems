# Assembly Language Project

## Overview

This project contains a program written in assembly language, demonstrating low-level programming concepts and direct manipulation of hardware or system resources. It showcases the use of assembly language instructions to achieve specific tasks that require precise control over CPU operations.

## Features

- **Direct Hardware Manipulation**: The program interacts directly with the processor and memory, showcasing efficient, low-level operations.
- **Instruction-Level Control**: Provides precise control over program execution at the instruction level, allowing for optimizations in performance.
- **Educational Example**: Useful for learning or demonstrating assembly language programming and understanding computer architecture.

## Project Structure

- `es_int.s` - Main assembly file containing the core instructions and logic for the program.

## Getting Started

1. **Assemble the program**:
   Use an assembler (such as `nasm` or `gcc`) to compile the assembly code. For example:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 es_int.s -o es_int.o
Link the object file: Link the assembled object file to create an executable:

bash

ld es_int.o -o es_int
Run the program: Execute the compiled program:

bash

./es_int
## Requirements
- Assembler: nasm or gcc (or another compatible assembler for the architecture in use).
- Linker: ld for linking the object file into an executable.
## Technologies Used
- Assembly Language: For low-level programming and direct system control.
- Linux (or compatible OS): For compiling and running the assembly code.
